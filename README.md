# Science Car Tracker Data Logger - GitHub

Welcome! This is a device which can measure movement properties (distance, speed, and acceleration) of rubber band or mouse trap model cars. Intended for science classes studying motion and Newton's laws, this STEM project combines an understanding of physics and motion, as well as engineering design, microcontrollers, and data analysis. 

Here you will find the **documentation**, **CAD files**, **wiring diagram**, and **code** behind the project. 

Have fun experimenting!
